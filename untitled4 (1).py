We must be like the grasshoppers and finish off the cockroaches. We must get rid of them.We will have to be like the grasshoppers that finish off the cockroaches. The only way to stop this is to have the Tutsi leave Rwanda. They must be sent back to Ethiopia. They will be repatriated, and they will no longer be a problem. If we donâ€™t do it, they will eventually kill us. We must act now before they destroy us."
